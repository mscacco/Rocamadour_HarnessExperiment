In this folder are contained the raw data to start running the R workflow that reproduce all the data processing and analyses (R scripts named "gitStep0", "gitStep1", "gitStep2" and "gitStep3"). 
Some of these data (the raw accelerometry data) required some manual processing to identify the calibration time and re-assign a corrected timestamp to each datapoint. This procedure is partially automatized in steps 0.1 and 0.2 of the script "gitStep0". To avoid this manual work, the accelerometry data with corrected timestamp are also provided (in folder "formatData"); therefore these two initial steps of script "gitStep0" can be skipped and the user can start from step 0.3.
