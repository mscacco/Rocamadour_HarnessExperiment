In this repository are contained all the R scripts and the initial data necessary to reproduce the pre-processing, the analyses and the results supporting the publication "Effect of tag attachment on flight parameters across five raptor species", Longarini et al. 2021.
To reproduce the workflow save the repository to your computer, and run in sequence the scripts "gitStep0", "gitStep1", "gitStep2" and "gitStep3". The path to the repository folder in the user's computer needs to be set at the beginning of each of the four scripts, by replacing the argument of the "setwd()" function.
